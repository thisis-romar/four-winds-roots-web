# Ported verbatim from claude-conversation-reader/.githooks/stop-git-check.sh
# (v1.1.0). Same behavior: refuses to let Claude Code stop with uncommitted,
# untracked, or unpushed work. Configured in .claude/settings.json under
# hooks.Stop.

# Read the JSON input from stdin
input=$(cat)

# Check if stop hook is already active (recursion prevention)
# Use grep instead of jq for portability (jq may not be installed)
